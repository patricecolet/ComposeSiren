ComposeSiren is an audio plugin that synthesize sounds of sirens made by [MÃ©canique Vivante][1].

The plugin allows to handle the seven-piece Siren Orchestra:
- two altos (called S1 and S2),
- a bass (called S3),
- a tenor (called S4),
- two sopranos (called S5 and S6),
- and a piccolo (called S7).

It is currently available on two formats: VST3 and Audio Unit.


### Development

ComposeSiren is developed on top of the **JUCE** frameworks. You can find more infos about it there: http://www.juce.com.

ComposeSiren is built on macOS as a 64-bit VST3 and Audio Unit formats, and currently tested on [Ableton Live][4].


### Using the plugin

The vst3 plugin file is called **ComposeSiren.vst3**, and the Audio Unit plugin file called **ComposeSiren.component**.
You can download the vst3 plugin as well as the Audio Unit plugin directly from the **Releases** menu (to the right of the list of files).

### Building with CMake

At the moment the plugin is built :

* on Mac OS 11.6.4 using Ninja (Xcode works too)
  * `cmake -B build -G Ninja -C Config.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to setup the build system
  * `cmake --build build --config Release` to build the plugins and generate the installer
* on Windows 10 using Visual Studio (couldn't get Ninja to work on windows yet)
  * `cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -C Config.cmake`
  * `cmake --build build --config Release`
  * `cpack --config build/CPackConfig.cmake`

The resulting installer (built with `productbuild` on mac and `NSIS` on windows)
is created in `build/Packaging/ComposeSiren_Installer_artefacts`
